Hi there stranger!

If you dont want to add any extensions for some reason, then the script from this folder might help you.
Just open browser's console, inject the code and press enter.
Call the paint_it_black() function every time you want to force a page to be in dark mode:
- Neverending scrolling.
- When page resets itself completely/partially to light mode.
- etc

P.S The code is small and simple. You can play around with configurations to achieve better results.
